  "findings": "Vision extraction worked well for TYPED/CLEAR mathematical notation. However, BLUEPRINT.md warns that GPT-4o-mini achieves ~24% Word Error Rate on handwritten content, with performance degrading as handwriting quality decreases. This test used relatively clear handwriting.",
  "importance": "CRITICAL - Vision accuracy determines if the student is even working on the right problem. Errors here cascade through entire tutoring session.",
  "score": 7.0,
  "score_reasoning": "Good performance on clear handwriting, but MAJOR LIMITATIONS exist: (1) Poor handwriting will cause significant errors, (2) Mathematical expressions in handwritten form have explicit limitations across all current vision models, (3) Geometric diagrams have <50% accuracy even with GPT-o1. Recommendation: Implement OCR pre-processing pipeline from BLUEPRINT.md for production.",
